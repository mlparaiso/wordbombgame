## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete

### Phase 1: UI Components (Priority)

You need to create these React components:

#### 1. **HomeScreen.js** - Main menu
```
Options:
- Play Solo (existing single-player)

- Join Game with Code
```

#### 2. **CreateGameScreen.js** - Host creates game
```
Features:
- Enter host name
- Select game mode (VS All, Team 2v2, Team 3v3, Team 4v4)
- Select difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Generate room code
- Navigate to lobby
```

#### 3. **JoinGameScreen.js** - Players join
```
Features:
- Enter player name
- Enter 6-digit room code
- Validate and join room
- Navigate to lobby
```

#### 4. **LobbyScreen.js** - Pre-game waiting room
```
Features:
- Display room code prominently
- Show all connected players in real-time
- Host controls:
  * Assign teams (if team mode)
  * Start game button
- Player list with team indicators
- Real-time player join/leave updates
```

#### 5. **MultiplayerGameScreen.js** - Live gameplay
```
Features:
- Same letter combo for all players
- Individual input and timer
- Real-time answer feed (see who answered what)
- Live scoreboard sidebar
- Round progression
- Team scores (if team mode)
```

#### 6. **ScoreboardScreen.js** - Round/Final results
```
Features:
- Podium display (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Full rankings
- Team standings (if team mode)
- Round-by-round breakdown
- Play again / Return to menu buttons
```

### Phase 2: App.js Integration

Update `App.js` to:
1. Add routing between screens
2. Manage global game state (roomCode, playerId, gameMode)
3. Handle real-time subscriptions
4. Coordinate screen transitions

### Phase 3: Styling

Create CSS files for new components matching the elegant design:
- `HomeScreen.css`
- `CreateGameScreen.css`
- `JoinGameScreen.css`
- `LobbyScreen.css`
- `MultiplayerGameScreen.css`
- `ScoreboardScreen.css`

## 🎮 Game Flow

### Creating a Game
```
1. User clicks "Create Game"
2. Enters name, selects mode & difficulty
3. System generates room code (e.g., "A3X9K2")
4. Host enters lobby
5. Room code displayed prominently
6. Other players can join
7. Host assigns teams (if team mode)
8. Host starts game
9. All players see same letter combo
10. Players submit answers
11. Real-time score updates
12. Round ends, show scoreboard
13. Next round or game over
```

### Joining a Game
```
1. User clicks "Join Game"
2. Enters name and room code
3. System validates code
4. Player enters lobby
5. Sees other players
6. Waits for host to start
7. Game begins for all players simultaneously
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Real-time Data Flow

```
Player Action → Supabase Database → Real-time Broadcast → All Players Update
```

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js with Hooks
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time)
- **Validation:** Datamuse API
- **Deployment:** Netlify (frontend) + Supabase Cloud (backend)

### Database Tables

**game_rooms**
- Stores room metadata
- Tracks game status (waiting/playing/finished)
- Holds game settings

**players**
- Player information
- Scores
- Team assignments
- Host designation

**game_state**
- Current round info
- Letter combination
- Timer settings
- Updated in real-time

**answers**
- Player submissions
- Points earned
- Timestamps
- Used for leaderboards

## 📱 Features Breakdown

### Game Modes

1. **VS All** - Free-for-all competition
   - Everyone competes individually
   - Single leaderboard
   - Winner takes all

2. **Team 2v2** - 2 players per team
   - Teams compete for combined score
   - Team leaderboard + individual stats
   - Collaborative strategy

3. **Team 3v3** - 3 players per team
   - Same as 2v2 but larger teams

4. **Team 4v4** - 4 players per team
   - Same as 2v2 but larger teams

### Scoring System
- Base points: word length × 5 (minimum 10)
- Speed bonus: Extra points for quick answers
- Team mode: Individual points contribute to team total

  );
  // Navigate to lobby
};
```

### Real-time Player Updates
```javascript
import { subscribeToPlayers } from './lib/gameService';

useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = subscribeToPlayers(roomCode, () => {
    // Refresh player list
    loadPlayers();
  });
  
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [roomCode]);
```
