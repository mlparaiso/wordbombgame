# ü§ñ Bot Player Implementation Guide

## Overview

Bot players have been successfully implemented in Word Bomb! Bots are AI-controlled players with animal-themed names (like "SwiftFox", "LazyPanda") that can join games and compete against human players.

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Core Bot System
- **Bot Name Generator**: Generates unique animal-themed names (Adjective + Animal)
- **Bot Service**: Rule-based word selection using the existing dictionary
- **Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: 3-5s response time, 4-6 letter words, 10% fail rate
  - **Medium**: 2-3s response time, 5-8 letter words, 5% fail rate
  - **Hard**: 1-2s response time, 7-12 letter words, 2% fail rate

### ‚úÖ UI Integration
- **Create Game Screen**: Toggle to enable bots, select count (1-7) and difficulty
- **Lobby Screen**: Bot players shown with ü§ñ icon and difficulty badge
- **Game Screen**: Bots answer during rounds with realistic timing

### ‚úÖ Database Support
- New columns in `players` table: `is_bot`, `bot_difficulty`
- New columns in `game_rooms` table: `enable_bots`, `bot_count`, `bot_difficulty`
- Migration file: `supabase_migrations/010_add_bot_support.sql`

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **src/lib/botNames.js** - Bot name generation
2. **src/lib/botService.js** - Bot logic and word selection
3. **supabase_migrations/010_add_bot_support.sql** - Database schema
4. **BOT_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - This documentation

### Modified Files
1. **src/components/CreateGameScreen.js** - Added bot options UI
2. **src/components/LobbyScreen.js** - Added bot indicators
3. **src/components/MultiplayerGameScreen.js** - Bot gameplay integration
4. **src/lib/gameService.js** - Bot creation on room setup
5. **src/App.js** - Pass bot parameters through

## How to Test

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- Copy contents from supabase_migrations/010_add_bot_support.sql
-- and execute in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Step 2: Create a Game with Bots
1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Click "Create Game"
3. Enter your name
4. Check "ü§ñ Fill empty slots with bots"
5. Select number of bots (1-7)
6. Choose bot difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
7. Click "Create Room"

### Step 3: Observe Bot Behavior
- **In Lobby**: Bots appear with ü§ñ icon and difficulty badge
- **During Game**: 
  - Bots submit answers with realistic delays
  - Easy bots: slower, shorter words, occasional timeouts
  - Hard bots: faster, longer words, rarely timeout
  - Bot names like "SwiftFox", "CleverRaven", "LazyPanda"

### Step 4: Test Different Scenarios
1. **Solo with Bots**: Create game with just you + bots
2. **Mixed Game**: Invite friends and add bots
3. **Bot-only Game**: Create game as spectator with only bots
4. **Different Difficulties**: Test easy vs hard bots
5. **Team Mode**: Bots work in team modes too

## Bot Behavior Details

### Word Selection Algorithm
```javascript
1. Load dictionary from public/words.txt
2. Filter words containing the current combo
3. Filter by word length (based on difficulty)
4. Exclude already-used words
5. Pick random word from filtered list
6. Add realistic delay before submitting
```

### Timing & Realism
- **Variable Delays**: Random within difficulty range
- **Failure Simulation**: Bots occasionally timeout
- **No Cheating**: Bots use same dictionary as players
- **Fair Play**: Bots can't see other answers before submitting

### Example Bot Names
- SwiftFox ü¶ä
- LazyPanda üêº
- CleverRaven ü¶Ö
- BraveLion ü¶Å
- QuietMouse üê≠
- WildWolf üê∫
- HappyOtter ü¶¶
- SneakyRaccoon ü¶ù

## Troubleshooting

### Bots Not Appearing
- Check database migration was applied
- Verify `enable_bots` checkbox is checked
- Check browser console for errors

### Bots Not Answering
- Ensure you're the host (only host triggers bots)
- Check console logs for bot activity
- Verify dictionary file is accessible at `/words.txt`

### Database Errors
- Run migration: `supabase_migrations/010_add_bot_support.sql`
- Check RLS policies allow bot operations
- Verify columns exist: `is_bot`, `bot_difficulty`

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Phase 2 Ideas
- **Bot Chat Messages**: Pre-written responses ("Nice!", "GG!")
- **Bot Typing Indicator**: Show when bot is "thinking"
- **Bot Personalities**: Some prefer short/long words
- **Bot Learning**: Avoid words that previously failed

### Phase 3 Ideas
- **AI-Powered Bots**: Use AI API for smarter word selection
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Bots adjust to player skill
- **Bot Statistics**: Track bot performance
- **Custom Bot Names**: Let users name their bots

## Technical Architecture

```
Bot System Flow:
1. User enables bots in CreateGameScreen
2. gameService.createGameRoom() creates bot players
3. Bots appear in lobby with ü§ñ indicator
4. Game starts ‚Üí MultiplayerGameScreen triggers bots
5. Each bot calls simulateBotAnswer() with delay
6. Bot selects word from dictionary
7. Bot submits answer via submitAnswer()
8. Answer appears in real-time for all players
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Dictionary Caching**: Words loaded once and cached
- **Async Bot Answers**: Bots don't block main thread
- **Minimal Database Calls**: Efficient queries
- **No Server Load**: Bots run client-side (host's browser)

## Conclusion

The bot system is fully functional and ready for testing! Bots provide a great way to:
- Practice alone
- Fill empty slots in multiplayer
- Test game mechanics
- Create engaging single-player experience

Enjoy playing with your new AI opponents! üéÆü§ñ
